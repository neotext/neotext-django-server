<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="../">Adding Quote-Context using jQuery</a></h2>

<p>HTML Offers two tags, for use when quoting text: &lt;q&gt;, and &lt;blockquote&gt;</p>

<p>What most people are unaware of, is that these tags also contain a <b>"cite"</b> attribute:</p>

<blockquote>&lt;<b>q cite</b>="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/.."><span class="q">I took the initiative in creating the internet.</span><b>&lt;/q&gt;</b></blockquote>
<blockquote>&lt;<b>blockquote cite</b>="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/%3fsearch=Deuteronomy+8.html"&gt;<span class="blockquote">one does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord</span><b>&lt;/blockquote&gt;</b></blockquote>
<br />
<p>The "q" tag is for text within a paragraph (inline).  The "blockquote" tag is used for a quote that is broken out into its own separate paragraph.</p>

<p>Below are examples of how each of <b>these tags may be extended with javascript</b> and a server-side script to lookup the original source and <b>to provide additional context</b> to the quote:</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<h4>1. Inline quotation</h4>
<p><strong>A. So did Al Gore really claim to have invented the internet?</strong><br />(Hover over the <span class="q">red</span> inline-quote below to expand.)</p>

<p>The meme originated from an interview Gore did on March 8, 1999 with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer.  The quote in question is: <q cite="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2013/11/04/a-cautionary-tale-for-politicians-al-gore-and-the-invention-of-the-internet/">I took the initiative in creating the Internet.</q> Granted, Gore's response was self-serving, and poorly phrased, but it was off the cuff; and if you look at the context, he wasn't claiming to have invented the internet.  Rather, he was alluding to the fact that while he was a congressman, he was the prime sponsor of the 1991 "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Performance_Computing_Act_of_1991">High-Performance Computing and Communications Act</a>", which, among other things, paid for Netscape founder Marc Andreessen to create the Mosaic browser, which became Netscape, and then eventually re-emerged as Firefox.</p>


<p><strong>B. Is money the root of all evil?</strong></p>
<p>You may have heard the saying that <q cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%206&version=KJV">money is the root of all evil</q>. If a citation is requested, 1 Timothy 6:10 (KJV) may be provided.  The actual text is similar, but the subject of the sentence is different.</p> 

<!--
<h4>2 Blockquote Example:</h4>

<p>An alternative to popup windows can be used to expand exteded quotations.  
	<strong>Click on the arrows</strong> to expand the quote of <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+8&amp;version=NRSV" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 8</a> that Jesus recites: 
	
<h5><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+4%3A+1-11&version=NRSV" target="_blank">Matthew 4:3-4</a></h5></p>

"The tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread.” 4 But he answered, “It is written,"
 
<blockquote cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+8&amp;version=NRSV">one does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord</blockquote>
-->

<p><strong>C. Why hast though forsaken me:</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why Jesus cried out:</p>
	
<blockquote cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+4%3A27&version=NIV">45 From noon on, darkness came over the whole land[p] until three in the afternoon. 46 And about three o’clock Jesus cried with a loud voice, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?” that is, <q cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+22&version=NIV">My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?</q></blockquote>

<!--
"5 Then the devil took him to the holy city and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple, 6 saying to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down; for it is written,
<blockquote>‘He <q cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2091&version=NRSV">will command his angels concerning you</q>,’
	and ‘<q cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2091&version=NRSV">On their hands they will bear you up, so that you will not dash your foot against a stone</q>.’”
</blockquote>
7 Jesus said to him, “Again it is written, ‘<q cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%206&version=NRSV">Do not put the Lord  your God to the test</q>’”




<br /><br />
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>(Note that I haven't quite got the user interface right when the linking gets crowded -- the popups get unwieldy. 
	One way to solve this would be to make the links only popup when they are clicked on.)



<h4>2. Blockquote</h4>
<p>The second type of quotation involves an entire block of text, that is separated from other paragraphs.  The below example allows the text to be expanded without a popup:</p>
		<p><strong>Click on the arrows</strong> to expand the <strong>blockquote</strong>:</p>

<br /><br />
<h4><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+4%3A+1-11&version=NRSV" target="_blank">Matthew 4:3-7</a></h4>
The tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread.” 4 But he answered, It is written, <q cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%208&version=NRSV">one does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of</q> God.”   5 Then the devil took him to the holy city and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple,   6 saying to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down; for it is written, ‘He <q cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2091&version=NRSV">will command his angels concerning you</q>,’ 
	     and ‘On their hands they will bear you up,  
		so that you will not dash your foot against a stone.’”  7 Jesus said to him, “Again it is written, ‘<q cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%206&version=NRSV">Do not put the Lord  your God to the test</q>.’”

<h3>Example for Gerry:</h3>

<p>EMU's alumni newsletter profiled Gerry and Kyle Horst.  Kyle said, about joining the family business:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://emu.edu/now/crossroads/2013/05/13/third-generation-joins-horst-son/">When I left KPMG I was a manager, putting in a lot of hours,” says Kyle. “I wanted to be around when Avery was growing up. I didn’t want to sell my soul to the company.</blockquote>

<p>In commenting about the changing business conditions, Gerry Horst said: <q cite="http://emu.edu/now/crossroads/2013/05/13/third-generation-joins-horst-son/">Before banks begged me to take money, and now we have to prove that we don’t need it</q>.</p>

5 Know then in your heart that as a parent disciplines a child so the Lord your God disciplines you. 6 Therefore keep the commandments of the Lord your God, by walking in his ways and by fearing him. 7 For the Lord your God is bringing you into a good land, a land with flowing streams, with springs and underground waters welling up in valleys and hills, 8 a land of wheat and barley, of vines and fig trees and pomegranates, a land of olive trees and honey, 9 a land where you may eat bread without scarcity, where you will lack nothing, a land whose stones are iron and from whose hills you may mine copper. 10 You shall eat your fill and bless the Lord your God for the good land that he has given you.

11 Take care that you do not forget the Lord your God, by failing to keep his commandments, his ordinances, and his statutes, which I am commanding you today. 12 When you have eaten your fill and have built fine houses and live in them, 13 and when your herds and flocks have multiplied, and your silver and gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied, 14 then do not exalt yourself, forgetting the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, 15 who led you through the great and terrible wilderness, an arid wasteland with poisonous[b] snakes and scorpions. He made water flow for you from flint rock, 16 and fed you in the wilderness with manna that your ancestors did not know, to humble you and to test you, and in the end to do you good. 17 Do not say to yourself, “My power and the might of my own hand have gotten me this wealth.” 18 But remember the Lord your God, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth, so that he may confirm his covenant that he swore to your ancestors, as he is doing today.
